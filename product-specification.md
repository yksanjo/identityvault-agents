# Product 8: IdentityVault for Agents - Non-Human IAM Platform

## Executive Summary

IdentityVault for Agents is a purpose-built identity and access management (IAM) platform designed specifically for AI agents and autonomous systems. It provides granular access control, credential management, and audit capabilities for non-human identities operating in financial services environments.

## Product Vision

"Okta/CyberArk for AI agents" - Enable financial institutions to securely manage AI agent identities at scale while maintaining least-privilege access, complete audit trails, and regulatory compliance.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions are deploying AI agents with elevated privileges, but lack proper identity management:

**Credential Management**: AI agents need credentials to access systems, but traditional IAM doesn't handle non-human identities well
**Privilege Escalation Risk**: Agents with excessive permissions create insider threat vectors if compromised
**Audit Gaps**: Traditional IAM logs don't capture agent-specific context (which agent, what action, why)
**Scale Challenge**: Managing hundreds of agent identities manually is impossible
**Regulatory Risk**: Examiners require access control documentation, but agent access is often undocumented
**Compliance Burden**: Manual access reviews for agents cost $200K+ annually and take months

## Target Customer Profile

**Primary Buyers:**
- Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs)
- Heads of Identity & Access Management
- Chief Risk Officers (CROs)
- Heads of AI/ML Operations

**Institution Types:**
- Regional to G-SIB banks with multiple AI agents
- Fintech companies scaling agent deployments
- Trading firms with algorithmic agents
- PE portfolio companies with diverse AI initiatives

**Buying Triggers:**
- Scaling to 10+ AI agents (manual management becomes impossible)
- Post-incident remediation (compromised agent credentials)
- Regulatory examination findings on access controls
- Pre-IPO security audit requirements

## Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Agent Identity Lifecycle Management

**What it does:**
- Manages complete lifecycle of agent identities (provisioning, updates, de-provisioning)
- Maintains agent registry with metadata (purpose, owner, permissions)
- Tracks agent relationships (dependencies, shared credentials)
- Provides agent identity dashboard

**Lifecycle Stages:**
- **Provisioning**: Create agent identity, assign initial permissions
- **Active**: Agent in use, permissions may change
- **Suspended**: Temporarily disabled (maintenance, investigation)
- **Retired**: Agent decommissioned, credentials revoked

**Technical Implementation:**
- Agent registry database
- Provisioning APIs (REST, webhooks)
- Integration with identity providers (Okta, Azure AD)
- Automated workflows (Temporal, Camunda)

**User Value:**
- Centralized agent identity management
- Reduce manual overhead (automated provisioning)
- Maintain complete inventory (regulatory requirement)

### 2. Time-Bound, Task-Specific Credential Issuance

**What it does:**
- Issues credentials only when needed (just-in-time access)
- Sets expiration times (credentials expire after task completion)
- Restricts credentials to specific tasks (can't be used for other purposes)
- Provides credential usage analytics

**Credential Types:**
- **API Keys**: For API access (time-bound, scoped)
- **Database Credentials**: For data access (read-only, specific tables)
- **Service Accounts**: For system integration (limited permissions)
- **OAuth Tokens**: For third-party services (scoped, time-bound)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Credential generation engine (cryptographically secure)
- Time-based access control (expiration enforcement)
- Task-specific scoping (permission boundaries)
- Integration with secret management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

**User Value:**
- Reduce attack surface (credentials only valid when needed)
- Prevent credential misuse (task-specific scoping)
- Maintain least-privilege access

### 3. Integration with Enterprise Identity Systems

**What it does:**

- Provides zero-downtime rotation (new credentials before revoking old)
- Maintains rotation audit trail

**Rotation Policies:**
- **Time-Based**: Rotate every X hours/days/weeks
- **Event-Based**: Rotate on security events (compromise, policy violation)
- **Risk-Based**: Rotate high-risk credentials more frequently

- Validates agent can perform specific action (read vs. write, transfer vs. view)
- Provides context-aware authorization (time, location, conditions)
- Maintains action-level audit logs

**Authorization Granularity:**
- **Resource-Level**: Can agent access this system?
- **Action-Level**: Can agent perform this specific action?

- **Conditional**: Action allowed only if conditions met

**Technical Implementation:**

- Provides risk score dashboard (which agents are riskiest)
- Maintains de-provisioning audit trail

**Risk Factors:**
- **Behavioral Anomalies**: Unusual access patterns
- **Permission Level**: High-privilege agents = higher risk
- **Usage Patterns**: Inactive agents, excessive access
- **Security Events**: Compromise indicators, policy violations

**Technical Implementation:**
- Risk scoring engine (ML models, rule-based)
- Automated de-provisioning workflows
- Integration with agent platforms (disable agents)
